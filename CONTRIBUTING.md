# Contributing
Before you send pull request, make sure that:

- changes in code or new features are tested so the [coverage](https://codecov.io/github/damianszczepanik/cucumber-reporting) remains on the same level
- UX should be tested by [additional tests](https://github.com/damianszczepanik/cucumber-reporting/tree/master/src/test/java/net/masterthought/cucumber/generators)
- code is written according to best practice and code clean
